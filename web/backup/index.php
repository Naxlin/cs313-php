		<h3 class="index-h3">Dalgoni Codex Description</h3>
		<p class="index-p">The Dalgoni Codex is a collection of knowledge about the world of Dalgoni, the Dalgonia language, and the Dalgonian people. It contains insight into the unique natural laws, the details of various kingdoms, and the common practices of different cultures and races.</p>
		<h3 class="index-h3">Disclaimer</h3>
		<p class="index-p">Much of the knowledge on the Dalgonians has yet to be translated into English, so the content of this site is limited. However, a document about some of the creatures of Dalgoni has been deciphered and is contained on the <span class="bold">Creatures</span> tab.</p>
