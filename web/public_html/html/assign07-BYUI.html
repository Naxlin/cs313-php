			  	<p>BYU-Idaho is distinctive in the world of higher education 
			  	because it is student-focused by design. That means we put the 
			  	students' success at the heart of all we do. The fruit of this 
					focus can be found in what students accomplish here and in the 
					following five educational emphases: </p>
			  	<p>Because of the shared commitment to live the gospel by 
			  	everyone on campus—student, faculty, and employees—BYU-Idaho is 
			  	a comfortable place to learn and grow as a disciple of Jesus 
			  	Christ.</p>
			  	<p>BYU-Idaho faculty members are not only experts in their 
			  	respective fields, but they also put teaching and mentoring 
			  	students as their top priority. That translates into more 
			  	face-to-face time and individual help for you because they care 
			  	most about helping you learn and succeed.</p>
			  	<p>From internships to practical assignments to career 
			  	preparation, BYU-Idaho classes are designed to give you 
			  	real-world experience. So are the thousands of opportunities to 
			  	participate in a wide array of activities outside the classroom. 
			  	You'll find opportunities to get involved at every level of 
			  	responsibility, whether you choose sports, outdoor activities, 
			  	the arts, service, and more. These programs are organized and led 
			  	by students who then develop skills and confidence valuable to 
			  	employers.</p>
			  	<p>Whether you're an academic rock star or the equivalent of the 
		  		guy playing the triangle in a garage band, BYU-Idaho will help 
			  	you discover and achieve your potential.</p>
			  	<p>BYU-Idaho operates on the imperative to offer a high-quality 
			  	education at a low cost to as many students as possible. That 
			  	translates into big savings for you.</p>
