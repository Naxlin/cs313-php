      Welcome to the haunted site of Howling Halloween!</h2>

      <br/>

      <p style="border-radius: 5px; width: 760px;">We have come from the 
      shadows to share with the world the darkest things we have seen with 
      our own eyes and to help you blend in with the terrors of the night. 
      The most deadly of them all has a howl that will shiver your spine off. 
      With great effort we have recorded this beast and its terror can be 
      viewed below.</p>

         <p style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 0px; 
         width: auto;" class="floatLeft"><span>Freaky....</span> There's a lot 
         we don't know about this monsterous creature, because all who have tried 
         to gather more information have died soon after hearing the ominous 
         howls...<img src="../resources/howl.jpg" style="display: inline-block;

         So even we, who have seen the darkest of darkness, have to wonder what 
         this thing is capable of. Some think that it spends most of its residence 
         underground, in a lair buried in the depths of the earth. Others believe 
         that it migrates great distances feeding on deer and other large animals 
         until it finds a suitable place with many unsuspecting prey. Whatever 
         people believe, one thing is certain; <span>if you live near the lair or 
         migratory path of one of these beasts, it is only a matter of time... 
         before they eat you.</span></p>

      <p style="float: right; max-width: 820px; width: 80%;" class="block">
         <span>There is one way to avoid this certain and terrifying demise.
         </span> We have been observing these beasts from a great distance for 
         some time and have determined that they don't attack things that are 
         just as frightening as them. We offer a large selection of <span>
         costumes that will keep these beasts weary and distant</span>, just 
         follow the link at the top of the page, <span>purchase one of our 
         costumes</span>, and you can be safe in 3 to 5 business days!</p>
