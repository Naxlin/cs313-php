			<h3><strong>Dalgonian Creature Descriptions & History</strong></h3>
			<p class="creatures-p">Dalgoni is a planet many solar systems away from earth. On this planet 
			machines are rare and magic and martial weapons rule the lands of humans, 
			elves, dwarves, and many other intelligent races. Living in the wilds 
			away from civilizations are animals, beasts, creatures, and monsters of 
			all kinds. The mages of Ithele'en tower have explored the lands to discover 
			as many of these creatures as they can, some perishing from the dangers 
			that lurk in the dark depths, or brilliant heights.</p>
			<p class="creatures-p">The mages of Ithele'en have discovered that many of the most dangerous 
			creatures are found on the Southern Continent known as Elquior. Dragons 
			rule the land and hunt any human that tries to land there, but a few mages 
			were able to slip past them into the mountain tall forests, ten mile deep 
			lakes, and other such extreme elements.</p>
			<p class="creatures-p">Some of their discoveries have been scribed to scrolls and archived in 
			the Ithele'en tower's rich libraries for other scholars to study. The 
			Ithele'en tower is one of the most secure places on Dalgoni, but even they 
			are susceptible to unexplained magical anomalies, and on one particular 
			night a dimensional connection occurred between Dalgoni and Earth and some 
			of those scrolls slipped through to our world. Those scrolls were on some 
			of the creatures that live on Dalgoni and the scrolls have been transcribed 
			to this site for all to see.</p>

		  	<h2>Saber Wolves</h2>
		  	<div>
		  		<img id="img01" src="creatures/creature01.jpg" 
		  		alt="Dalgonian Saber Wolf">
		  		<p>They are found on Elquior, living in the dense parts of the towering 
		  		and overgrown forests. They often dig burrows at the base of trees by 
		  		digging dirt from underneath some of the roots.</p>
		  		<p>The name saber wolf was given to these creatures because they look 
		  		similar to normal wolves except that they are giants, and because of their 
		  		size their teeth are as long as sabers. Dispite their size they have high 
		  		agility and reflexes, making them a dangerous preditor for even the other 
		  		giants of the skyscraper forests.</p>
		  		<p>These giant wolves started out as normal wolves who evolved over time 
		  		as they adapted to the extreme environment the elemental war caused. They 
		  		absorbed some of the residual magic that lingered in the forests from the 
		  		war and became magical themselves. Over time they became more intelligent 
		  		and learned how to harness their magic into the form of protective shields. 
		  		Back during the time when humans were allowed to live and visit Elquior, 
		  		some humans formed a symbiotic relationship with the saber wolves and a 
		  		tribe of wolf riders was born. When the dragons turned on humanity, the 
		  		saber wolves through their powerful shields and because of their fatal 
		  		loyalty stood against the dragons and kept their tribe from being broken 
		  		apart. To this day the only humans on Elquior are the wolf riders, who 
		  		continue to live with their canine companions.</p>

		  	<h2>Sandworms</h2>
		  	<div>
		  		<img id="img02" src="creatures/creature02.jpg" 
		  		alt="Dalgonian Sandworm">
		  		<p>They are found on the Northern Continent called Alasia in the Eastern 
		  		desert wildlands. They bore lairs out of the solid rock beneath the sands 
		  		where they rest and keep their young, but they are more frequently laying 
		  		wait within the sands for the vibrations of prey to reach them.</p>
		  		<p>Sand worms vary in size, they are the size of snakes when they are 
		  		babies, but can grow up to two hundred feet long and twenty to thirty feet 
		  		in diameter. Their entire body can flex flat and extend spines off their 
		  		sides, this makes it easier for them to burrow through the sand and the 
		  		spines act like antennas for the vibrations of their prey. They have three 
		  		layers of teeth on jaws that can flex flat like their body. They do not 
		  		rely on vision, but vibrations when they are underground and a keen sense 
		  		of smell when they are above ground.</p>
		  		<p>Sand worms were an unpleasant discovery for the people who first 
		  		explored the eastern deserts. Imagine traveling through the sands in search 
		  		of water, when all of a sudden the very dunes themselves come alive to feast 
		  		upon you and your company. Especially when you find they burrow as fast as 
		  		horses gallop…. One unfortunate soul found that sandworms are so sensitive 
		  		to vibrations they can feel the beat of a heart through the soles of your 
		  		feet and fifty feet of sand, they had only the time to telepath this find 
		  		before they sank into the gapping maw of their doom. After sandworms were 
		  		discovered, deserts became avoided, because certain death awaited all who 
		  		dared travel the lands of the writhing dunes.</p>

		  	<h2>Werewolves</h2>
		  	<div>
		  		<img id="img03" src="creatures/creature03.jpg" 
		  		alt="Dalgonian Werewolf">
		  		<p>They are found during the night on Alasia in the wildlands to the North. 
		  		They den in caves and deep ravines away from sunlight.</p>
		  		<p>Werewolves look like a mix between timber wolves and humans, long limbed 
		  		with bulky shoulders. Their fur color is unique to each one depending on 
		  		what their human hair looked like before they turned. Their claws and teeth 
		  		are silvery and cold steel. Their eyes see in the dark, through a slight 
		  		infared spectrum; not enough to see through things, but enough to see prey 
		  		unlucky enough to be out in the open. They also hear as well as a wolf.</p>
		  		<p>Werewolves were a recent horrifying discovery that spread much like a 
		  		plague through the uncivilized north. Their bite spread the contagion 
		  		through infecting the blood of their victims with their black saliva. 
		  		Werewolves first came to be before the original dragon riders, when the 
		  		corrupted beings brewed a potion of poison that infected the body of a human, 
		  		changing their genetics to a mix of human and wolf…. The potion also 
		  		inflicted great and un-end-able pain upon the infected until they went mad. 
		  		Once the potion or saliva enters your veins you have till the next full moon 
		  		before the poison consumes you. The only known counter to this poison is 
		  		magic; you either have to have it flowing in your veins and the magic fights 
		  		it, or you have to have some kind of magically enchanted item that protects 
		  		agains poisons. Werewolves have insane regeneration and can’t be killed by 
		  		normal means: physical or even enchanted weapons can’t make an ending blow. 
		  		The only thing that can destroy them is a blast of pure light from magic. 
		  		But beware, because if you ever kill a single werewolf, every werewolf in 
		  		about a ten mile radius will come seeking revenge, because their pain is 
		  		linked and they will feel like they died and come seeking the one who 
		  		pained them.</p>

		  	<h2>Vampires</h2>
		  	<div>
		  		<img id="img04" src="creatures/creature04.jpg" 
		  		alt="Dalgonian Vampire">
		  		<p>Vampires are only found in small concentrations on Elquior, typically 
		  		within abandoned pre-elemental war temples or other abandoned structures.</p>
		  		<p>They are mostly human, except they have dragon-like wings, eyes, fangs, 
		  		and scales. They have the strength of 5 strong men, and have a great affinity 
		  		to the use of magic.</p>
		  		<p>Vampires didn't exist until toward the end of the dragon riders' reign. 
		  		A rogue faction formed within the dragon riders and sought to over throw the 
		  		government. As they fought their kin they drank the blood of their kin's 
		  		dragons, supposing by this to gain greater power. The blood of creatures with 
		  		magic grant those who partake of their blood with the properties of the 
		  		creature. By partaking of dragon blood, the rogue group began to transform 
		  		obtaining the wings, eyes, fangs, and scales of dragons, in addition to 
		  		increased physical strength and magical powers. The good dragons saw this and 
		  		became very angry with mankind and put a curse on their blood so anyone who 
		  		drank it would thirsted for the blood of humans. When the rogue group partook 
		  		of more dragon blood they craved human blood, and turned from their original 
		  		goal to seek to satisfy their new thirst. Their bite is not contagious, but the 
		  		unlucky who are bit rarely live. Vampires are still rare, but grew from the few 
		  		dragon riders who rebelled through reproduction. Among the first vampires there 
		  		were three conspirators who led the rebellion. These three were barely able to 
		  		maintain leadership of their now disoriented army and slowly split into three 
		  		groups that became more and more distant; their leaders approaching their group's 
		  		new ‘needs’ in different ways. These three groups can still be found around 
		  		Elquior, though to find them is to donate blood.</p>

		  	<h2>Harpies</h2>
		  	<div>
		  		<img id="img05" src="creatures/creature05.jpg" alt="Dalgonian Harpy">
		  		<p>They are the rarest of rarities. Harpies are wanderers and don't have a place 
		  		to call home for various reasons. If you ever see one, you have done more than 
		  		many scholars have dreamed of doing.</p>
		  		<p>Harpies and vampires are indistinguishable, they look exactly the same and 
		  		have the same powers.</p>
		  		<p>They are some of the descendants of the vampires; they overcame the drinking 
		  		the blood of animals/humans by figuring out spells to counter the curse the 
		  		dragons placed on their ancestors. They changed from beasts who live by 
		  		themselves and attack every other creature that they come into contact with, to 
		  		an intelligent race of mages. Their abilities are the same as vampires; they 
		  		have the strength of five men they have wings and they have armor like scales, 
		  		they also have a good amount of magic. They have yet to get accepted into any 
		  		community though, because of the horrors their ancestors inflicted upon man. 
		  		There are not very many harpies to begin with, but they needed some unity to be 
		  		able to break out from under the thumb of the three Vampire clan leaders. There 
		  		are only about 68 of them in total. Because of their appearance they are forced 
		  		to travel the lands, because they are driven out wherever they go.</p>

		  	<h2>Dragons</h2>
		  	<div>
		  		<img id="img06" src="creatures/creature06.jpg" alt="Dalgonian Dragon">
		  		<p>They are the rulers of Elquior and live in the greatest mountain on 
		  		Dalgoni, which bears the name of the planet.</p>
		  		<p>Dragons have four legs, two massive wings, a long neck and tail, and 
		  		they are armored with scales. Every dragon can breath fire. There are six 
		  		different elemental dragons, fire, water, earth, air, light, and dark. 
		  		Each of these elemental dragons in addition to breathing fire can breath 
		  		an extreme form of their element. Of the elemental dragons light and dark 
		  		are the rarest and it seems as if only one can exist at a time.</p>
		  		<p>The dragons existed from before any race can remember. They have always 
		  		been the force of balance for the world, seeking to staunch darkness 
		  		wherever it appears. There came a time in history when the dragons were 
		  		not strong enough alone to face the darkness that threatened the world, so 
		  		they called upon the other races of the world to join forces with them to 
		  		overcome the darkness through a pact bond that welded the mind of a dragon 
		  		to the mind of another humanoid. Through this link each could cast greater 
		  		magic and dragon and rider together became the most powerful force in the 
		  		world. With this new found strength the dragons and riders were able to 
		  		push the darkness back and save the world from utter darkness. However, 
		  		there was darkness in the hearts of man and the dragon rider rebellion 
		  		occurred, causing dragons to lose trust in humans. This distrust lead to 
		  		the purge of Elquior, where the dragons forced all the humans to leave the 
		  		continent for Alasia with the warning that those who set foot on Elquior 
		  		again would be devoured. To this day dragons are feared for their threat 
		  		and the many cities they occasionally burn on Alasia to remind the short 
		  		lived humans that they still hate them.</p>
