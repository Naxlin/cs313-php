		<h3 class="index-h3">Jonathan Smith's Retirement Bio</h3>
		<p class="index-p">Jonathan Smith is a software engineer and creative writer, when not designing and creating programs, he is designing and narrating Sci-Fi and Fantasy worlds and characters.</p>
		<p class="index-p">To fuel his creativity, Jonathan wrote the popular program called Writer’s Assistant, which is a world building tool that inspires design, creation, and correlation between characters, places, and events in an organized, customizable interface.</p>
		<p class="index-p">Jonathan also designed and developed the Coin Counter App that has saved ward clerks around the world hundreds of hours of coin counting, by allowing them to count tithing via the camera of their phone.</p>
		<p class="index-p">Jonathan’s book series has obtained world-wide popularity and is comprised of 13 volumes, including the Eye of Purity duology, the Sora Kelriven duology, the Long Ranger duology, and the Dalgoni’s Fire Series.</p>
		<p class="index-p">Along side the creative writing, Jonathan applied himself with his friend and business partner Travis Anderson in programming the Senora game series that takes place in the same universe as Dalgoni’s Fire. This game series contains pristine graphics, intuitive UX, dynamic world generation and music, economy and civilization growth and decay, and shows just how far programming can allow the player to affect the destiny of an entire world.</p>
		<p class="index-p">Outside of his professional life, Jonathan had the privilege of marrying his beautiful wife Iskirra in the Portland, Oregon Temple, vowing to be hers for time and all eternity. They have three children, who are well on their way to creating and fulfilling grand dreams of their own.</p>
