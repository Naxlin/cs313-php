		<h3 class="index-h3">Site</h3>
		<p class="index-p">This website is designed by Jonathan Smith, and showcases his web engineering abilities and creative writing skills. Because creative writing is a big part of his life, the site will involve a lot of fantasy; however, all of the source code has also been written from scratch and the 'About' tab contains more professional information.</p>
		<h3 class="index-h3">Dalgoni Codex</h3>
		<p class="index-p">The Dalgoni Codex is a collection of knowledge gained from the world of Dalgoni, including things about the Dalgonia language and the Dalgonian people. It contains insight into the unique natural laws, the details of various kingdoms, and the common practices of different cultures and races.</p>
		<h3 class="index-h3">Disclaimer</h3>
		<p class="index-p">Much of the knowledge on the Dalgonians has yet to be translated into English, so the content of this site is limited. However, a document about some of the creatures of Dalgoni has been deciphered and is contained on the <span class="bold">Creatures</span> tab.</p>
